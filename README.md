# Authorship-Profiling-using-twitter-data

“Authorship Analysis”, which deals with classification of twitter texts into two classes i.e. genders namely “male” and “female”. It is mainly about gender classification task. This authorship profiling task is often formulated as a classification problem, where a classifier(Machine Learning Algorithms) is fed with a text(tweet text) and returns the corresponding gender who has tweeted it.  The different classifiers(Machine Learning algorithms) used in this task are “SVC”, “SGDClassifier”, “LSTM” and "CNN using GloVE”. The main steps involved before building the classifiers are pre-processing the data and generating the proper features(Feature Extraction), through which our machine learning algorithms could understand and predict the required classes.
